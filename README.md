# reddit_bot

This was a reddit bot that I created in Python using the PRAW package.

#### the code

The bot has been written in 'object orientation' in the sense that the bot object is somewhat separate and stand alone from the actual functionality of the bot.

The code has been documented with comments.

#### my thoughts

This particular bot was too easy to trigger. As such, people would abuse it to the point where it was quite spammy, leading to its eventual ban. If I were to do it again, I would consider creating a more specific or obscure trigger in order to make it less easy to get the bot to reply.
